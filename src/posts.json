  "Welcome! We're so excited to announce our new platform, possible social. On possible social, we're building the future of money for content creators.",
  "Likes are already a basic attention token. Most of the time you burn them on nothing at all - why not spend them funding other content creators, in a circular economy of like?",
  "The total amount of likes any content creator receives isn't what's really important: it's the velocity of likes. On possible social, we are optimizing for maximally liquid likes.",
  "Think about it - you're spending possible likes every minute. If only possible social lets you monetize likes, every like not spent on our platform is a like wasted.",
  "The daily withdrawal limit on likes is only limited by your fingers.",
  "Check back often - we'll be adding exciting new features regularly over the next month.",
  "Likework isn't like work, it is work. Make your likes work - for you."
